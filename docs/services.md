# Services

The **Services** view displays all the services that have been instantiated and managed by using Calm. Services that are not managed by Calm but are available on your virtualization platforms are also inlcuded in this view so that you don't have to log into your virtualization accounts to view and manage your services. 

You can also Stop and Restart services from this view, and have a look at the **Deployments** that your services are a part of. 

## Viewing Services

You can access **Services** by clicking on **Services** from the menu. 

The **Services** view lists all the services that are managed and not managed by Calm. The services are listed in a grid or a list view along with details such as  the following:

* VM Name

* Deployment
* State
* Provider Type
* Settings Name

The view of your services are paginated, depending on the number of services you have, and can be navigated using page numbers or by clicking **<** or **>**.
You can also search and filter services by clicking on the search bar and selecting an appropriate filter. You can search for and filter the services being listed based on their **State**, **Provider Type**, **Calm Managed**, **Machine Name**, **Deployment**, **VM IP**, **VM Name** and **Settings Name**. 

## Managing Services

The **Services** page also lets you Stop and Restart your services directly from Calm, thereby eliminating the need to log into your virtualization account to do these operations.

* Select the service from those that are listed in the **Services** view. This opens a panel on the right that contains details related to the service.
