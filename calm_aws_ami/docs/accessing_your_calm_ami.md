# Accessing Your Calm AMI

To access your Calm AMI, do the following:

1. Select the Calm AMI you launched from the list of **Running Instances** from your **EC2** dashboard. 

2. Copy the **Public DNS** and paste it into any web browser and hit **Enter**. This initiates the Calm setup wizard.

The Calm Setup Wizard will now take you through creating a Calm account and setting up your Calm instance for use.
