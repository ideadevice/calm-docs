# Before You Begin

Before you start using AWS with Calm, you need to deploy Calm from our AWS AMI. To do so, youâ€™ll need the following:

* An AWS account with valid credentials

* An IAM user account with the following permissions and access:

    * EC2 Full Permissions

    * IAM Read Only Access

To know more about creating an IAM user on AWS, go to [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).

* The Access Key ID and the Secret Access Key for your IAM user account with AWS. 

## Setting up an IAM User Account

We have developed a script that creates an IAM user along with the necessary permissions and a security group for deploying a Calm AMI. This script can be used with AWS CloudFormation to create an IAM user.
